# Assembly Operations for Record Processing

## Project Overview

This project involves implementing various operations in assembly language for reading records, computing values, reading lines, and printing lines. The project is structured to perform specific tasks using assembly programs.

## Features

- **Read Records:** Reads records from input using assembly.
- **Compute Values:** Computes specific values based on the read data.
- **Read Lines:** Reads lines from input using assembly.
- **Print Lines:** Prints lines to output using assembly.

## File Structure

- **readrec.s:** Assembly program to read records.
- **compute.s:** Assembly program to compute values.
- **readlines.s:** Assembly program to read lines.
- **printlines.s:** Assembly program to print lines.
- **Makefile:** The makefile to compile the programs.
- **lab7Readme:** The readme file provided with detailed instructions and requirements.
